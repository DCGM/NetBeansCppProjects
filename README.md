NetBeansCppProjects
===================

NetBeansProjects

git repository must be cloned in /home/ireznice/somedir
because of the NetBeansIDE stores all paths in a relative way.

the content of AllInOne directory should be working everywhere on medusa, 
when moved elsewhere the LIB directories and include directories in file Makefile.i should be changed accordingly
to build the projects just type:
./make_struct
make

to clean the mess just type: 
make clean
